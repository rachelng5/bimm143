```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here we read the results of the RNA-seq for about ~230 samples (people) w different genotypes for the Asthma associated SNP: rs8067378:

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)

```

Extract the A/A rows i.e. where the $geno is equal to "A/A"
```{r}
AA = expr$exp[expr$geno == "A/A"]
mean(AA)
```
Extract the G/G rows
```{r}
GG = expr$exp[expr$geno == "G/G"]
mean(GG)
```

Time to boxplot
Reference boxplot help page for documentation
```{r}
boxplot(exp ~ geno, data = expr, notch = TRUE)
```
